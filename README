Eldav: Yet another WebDAV interface for Emacsen

Eldav provides an interface to the WebDAV servers for Emacs.


Features

 ・ WebDAV files can be treated just like a normal file.
 ・ Emacs/w3 is not required. External program is used for WebDAV access.


Requirements

 ・ Emacs
 ・ WebDAV server
 ・ nd (An WebDAV command line interface)


Install

APEL is required.
Use the latest APEL which is available at following URI.
ftp://ftp.m17n.org/pub/mule/apel/

Then, just put `eldav.el' and 'vc-eldav.el' (after byte-compiling, if you want)
on your load-path of Emacs.


Usage

Add following line to your .emacs.

(require 'eldav)

If you want to use proxy server, following setting is also needed.

(setq eldav-proxy "http://your.proxy.server:8080")

Then you can access WebDAV files by specifying magic file name like:

:http://your.webdav.server/path/to/file/name

(Add preceding ':' to the WebDAV URL.)


VC (Version Control)

Eldav implements VC backend (Note that it is experimental).

Eldav VC feature is enabled if you put following line in your setting.

(setq eldav-use-vc t)

If Eldav VC fearure is enabled, the file is locked and access from another
person is rejected (WebDAV LOCK feature).

If you open new WebDAV file, you'll be asked like following.

File was lost; check out from version control? (yes or no)

Answer 'yes' here and check-out the file.

If you open an existing WebDAV file, it appears on read-only buffer. Type 'C-x
v v' on this buffer, then file is checked-out and becomes editable.

If the file is checked-out, the file cannot be accessed from another person by
locking mechanism.

After editing and saving, you have to type 'C-x v v' to check-in to unlock the
file. At this time, '*VC-Log*' buffer appers. Just type 'C-c C-c' to continue
(all texts in the *VC-Log* buffer is ignored).


Known Problems

 ・ File completion causes many PROPFIND requests.
 ・ SSL is not supported (because `nd' does not handle it).
